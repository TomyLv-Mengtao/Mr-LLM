This pattern of quick eye movements is typical of abnormality detection where the pilot is actively searching for irregularities or issues."
1-BB2AA_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice1.json,Neg,1,"The gaze trace contains multiple 'saccade' entries, indicating rapid eye movements, and the presence of 'ND' (likely 'Non-Detection') and 'PFD' (Primary Flight Display) entries suggest the pilot is actively scanning and detecting abnormalities. Additionally, elevated pupil dilation measurements further support focused and intense visual activity consistent with abnormality detection."
16-BB2AA_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice2.json,Neg,1,"The gaze trace shows alternating sequences of 'Others' and 'saccade' with relatively short durations for 'saccade' and consistent pupil sizes.

Additionally, the occurrence of multiple saccades with varied pupil dilation suggests a focused search behavior rather than routine monitoring."
8-BB2AA_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice2.json,Neg,1,"The gaze trace indicates that the pilot's attention is shifting between various cockpit systems and the external environment. In particular, the presence of multiple saccades combined with the monitoring of different instruments like FCU, ECAM and MFD, as well as the notable variation in pupil size, suggest heightened cognitive workload and active scanning. This pattern aligns with behavior commonly associated with abnormality detection rather than routine monitoring."
11-AA2BB_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice1.json,Neg,0,"The majority of the gaze trace (3516 ms for 'Others' and 531 ms for 'Others') indicates the pilot's focus is primarily not on specific instruments or controls but rather on generalized areas. The limited engagement with the MCDU (430 ms total) and frequent saccades do not strongly indicate focused abnormality detection behavior, which would likely involve more sustained and targeted viewing of specific instruments or panels."
2-AA2BB_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice1.json,Neg,1,The gaze trace indicates the pilot is frequently switching their gaze (multiple saccades) and examining detailed areas (high PFD values). The combination of saccadic movements and varying PFDs suggests the pilot is actively scanning for abnormalities rather than passively monitoring.
1-BB2AA_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice2.json,Neg,1,"The gaze trace includes multiple saccades and changes in pupil size, which suggests scanning behavior typically associated with abnormality detection rather than normal monitoring. The presence of saccades indicates that the pilot is likely shifting their gaze frequently to check various instruments or areas, a typical behavior when searching for irregularities."
1-AA2BB_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice1.json,Neg,1,"The gaze trace shows a mix of long fixations (PFD: 1222 ms, ECAM and MFD: 862 ms) and shorter saccades, which indicates that the pilot is focusing intently on specific instruments and possibly scanning for abnormalities or unusual indications. This pattern is consistent with conducting abnormality detection rather than just routine monitoring."
7-AA2BB_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice1.json,Neg,1,The pilot's gaze trace indicates a pattern of focused inspection on the MCDU with consistent pupil dilation and intermittent saccades. This could suggest an effort to detect abnormalities rather than regular monitoring.
2-AA2BB_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice2.json,Neg,1,"The high percentage of saccades (quick eye movements) in the gaze trace, especially with several instances of high pupil dilation, suggests the pilot is actively scanning and potentially looking for abnormalities rather than just conducting normal monitoring."
13-AA2BB_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice2.json,Neg,1,"The gaze trace shows the pilot alternating focus between the ECAM and MFD (which display system and monitoring information) and the ND (Navigation Display), along with frequent saccades, which suggests active scanning. This behavior is indicative of abnormality detection rather than routine monitoring."
11-BB2AA_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice1.json,Neg,1,"The gaze trace indicates rapid saccades interspersed with fixation periods (ND). Rapid saccades followed by fixations are typical of abnormality detection, as the pilot scans different areas quickly to identify any issues. The consistent pupil dilation during NDs and the quick transitions also support the hypothesis that the pilot is actively searching for abnormalities."
17-AA2BB_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice2.json,Neg,1,"The presence of saccades within the gaze trace suggests active scanning behavior, which is often associated with abnormality detection.

This pattern is consistent with a focused search for anomalies rather than routine scanning."
18-BB2AA_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice2.json,Neg,1,"The gaze trace shows multiple saccades and fixations (PFD), with varying Pupil sizes. The presence of a significant non-detection (ND) period and shorter, frequent saccades suggest increased scanning behavior, which is indicative of abnormality detection rather than normal monitoring."
11-AA2BB_Task2-RandomSlice_Slice2.json,Neg,1,"The given gaze trace indicates that the pilot's eye movements predominantly consist of saccades with occasional periods of fixation (Others). The varying pupil sizes suggest that the pilot's attention is dynamically shifting, which is consistent with a behavior of actively scanning the environment for abnormalities rather than just conducting routine monitoring."
